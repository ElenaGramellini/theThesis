\chapter{Acknowledgements} % this needs to be before \mainmatter.
A lot of people are awesome, especially you, since you probably agreed to read this when it was a draft. 
%But you, who is reading my thesis before it's done without my permission, you're the worst.
%The truth is, younger Elena was a theorists at heart and didn't know. She absolutely loved QFT. But, she hated every single person of her class who self-identified as a theorist. She swore never to become one of them and buried that love deep in her heart, never to be touched by those jerks who traded in Lagrangians and measurements of each other's dicks. Was that love not strong enough to overcome the filth of the everyday shade?  Was she not armored enough to shield from other people?s low self-esteem? Who?s fault was that? Not the theorist?s? she always thought it was hers, but was it?  I don?t know. But sure, younger Elena had to find a way to get by. And she did. Painfully, with a lot of bruises and an ocean across. But she did.

% A big thank you to my academic sisters, a bunch of extraordinary women who have taught me so much on the value
%from the youngest to the oldest (again academically speaking). Supraja, Brooke, the depth of your knowledge, your drive and love for our field is a constant inspiration;  Ariana, thanks for keeping me sane for the last four year, love and hugs to you dudette; and last but not least Xiao, I don't think Fermilab has given me a bigger gift than your friendship.
